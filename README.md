**NOTE**: This crate is a fork the [`confy`](https://github.com/rust-cli/confy) crate.

# Conpot

Zero-boilerplate configuration management.

Focus on storing the right data, instead of worrying about how or where to store it.

```rust
use serde_derive::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Default, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct MyConfig {
    version: u8,
    api_key: String,
}

fn main() -> Result<(), ::std::io::Error> {
    let cfg: MyConfig = conpot::load("my-app-name", None)?;
    dbg!(cfg);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Using yaml
Enabling the `yaml_conf` feature while disabling the default `toml_conf`
feature causes conpot to use a YAML config file instead of TOML.

```
[dependencies.conpot]
features = ["yaml_conf"]
default-features = false
```

## Breakings changes
### Version 0.5.0
* As [`directories`] stopped being maintained we switch to [`directories-next`]. Both crates released a breaking change regarding default configuration path change on macos. For further information check their changelog.
* The base functions `load` and `store` have been added an optionnal parameter in the event multiples configurations are needed, or ones with different filename.
* The default configuration file is now named "default-config" instead of using the application's name. Put the second argument of `load` and `store` to be the same of the first one to keep the previous configuration file.
* It is now possible to save the configuration as toml or as yaml. The configuration's file name's extention depends on the format used.

### Version 0.4.0
Starting with version 0.4.0 the configuration file are stored in the expected place for your system. See the [`directories`] crates for more information.
Before version 0.4.0, the configuration file was written in the current directory.
